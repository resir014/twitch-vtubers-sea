# twitch-vtubers-sea

> Database of Twitch VTubers from South East Asia.

> **Heads up!**
>
> This project is a **proof of concept**, and still uses sample data of the VTubers that I know. Once the data structure is finalised, and a submission/removal process is laid out, I'll be opening this list out and will replace the "database" with actual data.
>
> Since I'm personally not that deeply-invested into the VTuber scene, I will need help in updating this database. Let me know at [@resir014](https://twitter.com/resir014) on Twitter if you're interested.
