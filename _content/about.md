---

While the rise of VTubers over the past few years — especially on the Southeast Asian
region — is incredible to see, we felt like there&apos;s not much love for VTubers who
primarily stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/).

Therefore, we sought to create this open and actively-updated database on well-known
VTubers who stream on this platform we all know and love!

## Contributing to the database

We're currently setting up a submission/removal process for the database. Watch this space for more updates!
